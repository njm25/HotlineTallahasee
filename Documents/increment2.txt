Stakeholder Communication
Subject: Increment 2 Progress Report on “Hotline Tallahassee”
Dear Stakeholders,
We are pleased to share the progress made during Increment 2 of the project “Hotline Tallahassee.”
In this phase, we introduced a health regeneration system and a new enemy type, Mangler, both of which enhance the gameplay experience. The map and spawn logic were updated to integrate these changes seamlessly. New assets and animations were also added to improve the visual appeal of the game.
Looking ahead, we aim to add a start screen, wave tracker, melee combat mechanics, and conduct extensive testing to refine performance.
Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to presenting further updates.
Best regards,
