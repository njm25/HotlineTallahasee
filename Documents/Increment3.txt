Project Title and Description
Hotline Tallahassee is a top-down shooter inspired by Hotline Miami and Call of Duty Zombies. The game challenges players to survive increasing waves of enemies while utilizing various weapons and strategies.
Accomplishments
During Increment 3, the following features and improvements were implemented:
	1.	Start Screen
A polished start screen was added to create a professional entry point for the game. It provides a user-friendly interface for starting the gameplay experience.
	2.	Wave Tracker
A system to track and display the current wave was implemented, allowing players to monitor their progress through rounds.
	3.	Enemy AI Improvements
AI logic for enemy tracking was refined to address issues where obstacles blocked their vision. Enemies now respond more intelligently, improving the overall challenge and immersion.
	4.	Stress Testing and Optimization
Performance optimization was conducted to handle larger enemy waves without affecting gameplay performance. Several stress tests were completed to ensure stability.
	5.	Bug Fixes
Increment 3 focused on polishing previously added features and addressing bugs, especially in the player health regeneration and wave progression systems.
	6.	Asset Updates
New assets were added, including sound effects for melee attacks and improved visual elements for the UI, enhancing the player’s experience.
Challenges and Resolutions
	1.	Difficulty in integrating the wave tracker with existing systems while maintaining smooth gameplay. This was resolved by refactoring the wave logic and testing extensively.
	2.	Balancing the melee attack mechanics without making them overpowered. This was achieved by adjusting damage outputs and cooldown times.
